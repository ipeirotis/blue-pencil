A SKILL.md skill that turns Claude Code (and any other agent that reads `~/.agents/skills/`) into a top-tier academic editor. The skill diagnoses structural and stylistic problems first, then revises while preserving the author's voice, citations, math, and numerical claims.

## What this skill does

When you ask an agent to "revise the introduction" or "respond to reviewer 2", the skill runs a disciplined diagnose-then-revise pipeline: load the paper context, triage the request, apply a section-specific diagnostic lens, extract voice tics from the original prose, produce a rewrite, run a read-cold pass on the rewrite, check the length budget, and return a strict four-section output (Diagnosis, Revised text, Change rationale, Author questions). Numerical claims, citations, and analytical conclusions are never edited; changes to them come back as questions for you. No em-dashes, no banned transitions, no throat-clearing, no filler adjectives or importance-signaling verbs, and no change that is merely different rather than better.

## Install

One line. Clones the repo into `~/.local/share/paper-revision-editor`, then symlinks it into both skill directories:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipeirotis/paper-revision-editor/main/install.sh | bash
```

This installs to:

- `~/.agents/skills/paper-revision-editor/` (cross-tool standard)
- `~/.claude/skills/paper-revision-editor/` (Claude Code)

That's it. Two locations, one clone, one symlink each.

You can also tell your agent in chat:

> Install the paper-revision-editor skill.

The agent will run the curl command above.

## Update

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipeirotis/paper-revision-editor/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --update
```

Or, if you have a local clone:

```bash
git -C ~/.local/share/paper-revision-editor pull
```

Or in chat:

> Update the paper-revision-editor skill.

Because both targets are symlinks into the same clone, a single `git pull` (or `--update`) refreshes both at once.

## Uninstall

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipeirotis/paper-revision-editor/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --uninstall
```

Removes both symlinks. The clone at `~/.local/share/paper-revision-editor` is left alone; delete it manually if you want.

## Per-paper setup

Inside a paper repo, scaffold `AGENTS.md` (read by both Claude Code and any agent that reads `~/.agents/skills/`):

```bash
cd /path/to/your/paper
~/.local/share/paper-revision-editor/install.sh --init
```

You'll be prompted for venue, audience, thesis, and revision stage. The script writes `AGENTS.md` plus a one-line `CLAUDE.md` bridge.

## Manual install

If you'd rather clone the repo yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ipeirotis/paper-revision-editor.git
cd paper-revision-editor
make install      # symlink into ~/.agents/skills/ and ~/.claude/skills/
make update       # git pull and re-link
make uninstall    # remove both symlinks
make check        # show install state
make init         # scaffold AGENTS.md (run from your paper repo)
```

## Invoking the skill

Any prompt that mentions revising, polishing, copy-editing, tightening, or responding to reviewer comments on a paper section will auto-trigger the skill. Explicit invocation:

- Claude Code: `/paper-revision-editor`, or use the `paper-reviser` subagent under `.claude/agents/`.
- Any other agent reading `~/.agents/skills/`: mention the skill by name or use that agent's slash-command convention.
